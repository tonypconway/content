{{APIRef("GroupDataName")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The `atributeStyleMap` read-only property of the {{DOMxRef("HTMLElement")}} interface provides read/write access to the {{htmlattrxref("style")}} attribute of an element. It exposes a map of the element's styles as a {{DOMxRef("StylePropertyMap")}}, which inherits methods from its parent, {{DOMxRef("StylePropertyMapReadOnly")}}.

## Value

Include a description of the property's value, including data type and what it represents.

## Examples

Note that we use the plural "Examples" even if the page only contains one example.

### A descriptive heading

Each example must have an H3 heading (`###`) naming the example. The heading should be descriptive of what the example is doing. For example, "A simple example" does not say anything about the example and therefore, not a good heading. The heading should be concise. For a longer description, use the paragraph after the heading.

See our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples) for more information.

> **Note:** Sometimes you will want to link to examples given on another page.
>
> **Scenario 1:** If you have some examples on this page and some more examples on another page:
>
> Include an H3 heading (`###`) for each example on this page and then a final H3 heading (`###`) with the text "More examples", under which you can link to the examples on other pages. For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> ### Using the fetch API
>
> Example of Fetch
>
> ### More examples
>
> Links to more examples on other pages
> ```
>
> **Scenario 2:** If you _only_ have examples on another page and none on this page:
>
> Don't add any H3 headings; just add the links directly under the H2 heading "Examples". For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> For examples of this API, see [the page on fetch()](https://example.org).
> ```
